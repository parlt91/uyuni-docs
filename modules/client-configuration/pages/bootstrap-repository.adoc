= Bootstrap Repository

A bootstrap repository contains packages for installing Salt on clients, as well as the required packages for registering Salt or traditional clients during bootstrapping.
Bootstrap repositories are automatically created and regenerated on the {productname} Server for every synchronized product.



== Prepare to Create a Bootstrap Repository

When you select a product for synchronization, the bootstrap repository is automatically generated as soon as all mandatory channels are fully mirrored.

There are two ways to check if a channel has finished synchronizing:

* In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard] and select the [guimenu]``SUSE Products`` tab.
This dialog displays a completion bar for each product when they are being synchronized. 
Some products also require extensions to be synchronized.
* You can also check the synchronization log file at the command prompt.
Use the [command]``cat`` or [command]``tail -f`` command to view the [path]``/var/log/rhn/reposync/channel-label.log`` file.
If you use this method, remember that base channels can contain multiple child channels.
Each of the child channels will generate its own log during the synchronization progress.
You will need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete.

== Options for Automatic Mode

=== Disable Flush Mode

By default, every regeneration starts with an empty repository and copies only the latest packages into it.
To disable this behavior, add or edit this value in [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``:

----
server.susemanager.bootstrap_repo_flush = 0
----

=== Disable Automatic Mode

If automatic regenration of the bootstrap repositories are not wanted, it can be disabled.
Add the following value in [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`

----
server.susemanager.auto_generate_bootstrap_repo = 0
----

=== Configure own Bootstrap Data File

The tool uses a data file with information about which packages are required for which distribution.
This data file can be found at [path]``/usr/share/susemanager/mgr_bootstrap_data.py``.
SUSE update this file regular.

In case you want to modify it, please create a copy in the same directory

----
$> cd /usr/share/susemanager/
$> cp mgr_bootstrap_data.py my_data.py
----

and edit your copy.
You can configure SUSE Manager to use your version by setting the following option in [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``

----
server.susemanager.bootstrap_repo_datamodule = my_data
----

[NOTE]
====
The original file will be overwritten with the next update.
You are responsible to keep your copy up to date with changes provided by SUSE to the original file.
====


== Generate a Bootstrap Repository Manually

By default, bootstrap repositories are regenerated daily.
You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt:

.Procedure: Generating the Bootstrap Repository for {sle}
. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, list the available bootstrap repositories:
+
----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -l
----
. Create the bootstrap repository, using the appropriate repository name as the product label:
+
----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-version-x86_64
----

The client repository is located in [path]``/srv/www/htdocs/pub/repositories/``.


.Procedure: Specify a Bootstrap Repository

If you have mirrored more than one {sle}{nbsp}15 Product (for example, SLES and SLES for SAP), you can specify the one you are actually interested in.

. Check what bootstrap repositories you have available:
+
----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-15-x86_64 --with-custom-channel
Multiple options for parent channel found. Please use option
--with-parent-channel <label> and choose one of:
- sle-product-sles15-pool-x86_64
- sle-product-sles_sap15-pool-x86_64
- sle-product-sled15-pool-x86_64
----
. Specify the appropriate repository:
+
----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-15-x86_64 --with-parent-channel sle-product-sled15-pool-x86_64
----
